# modules
* tutorials:
    - https://youtu.be/1RuMJ53CKds
    - https://youtu.be/CqvZ3vGoGs0
* the main purpose of modules is to isolate and group data and functionality in a similar manner that functions and classes do
* each python file with the `.py` extension constitute a module
* each module/file will group related data functionality:
    - data: variable
    - functionality: function, classes
* instead of writing all code to solve one big problem in one large file it is more advantageous to break down in a few files
* advantages of using modules:
    - reducing blast radius: making changes in one module should not break other modules since modules are isolated
    - allows using the same modules in multiple projects

```s
## from a logical point of view
BIG PROBLEM
    --> SMALLER PROBLEMS: files containing variables, functions, classes <------- modules
        --> EVEN SMALLER PROBLEMS: variables, functions, classes

## example of how a project can be broke down
myproject/
├── myproject.py      # <------ main script file where you import modules and use their variables, functions and classes
├── mymodule1.py      # <------ module file where you define variables, functions and classes
├── mymodule2.py
└── ... and so forth
```

## importing modules
* to be able to use a module variable, functions and classes you have to import the module first
* module's functions, classes, variables are not available outside their modules unless are imported
* the most straight forward way to import modules that are in the same to use the `import` statement plus the name of the module i.e. the name of the file without the `.py` extension:
    - module file: `examplemodule.py`
    - importing module: `import example module`
* things are getting more complicated if the module file it is not located in the same directory as the script importing the module but you have to specify the path to where the module is located
* you can import modules into other modules as well as main scripts

```python
## IMPORT myModule
## is best practice to be explicit when importing something from a module e.g. import specific functions, classes instead of everything
import myModule                                ## import whole module ! must to prepend your functions/classes with `myModule.`
import myModule as somenickname                ## import whole module ! must to prepend your functions/classes with `myModule.`
from myModule import *                         ## import all functions & classes from module
from myModule import myFunction1, myFunction2, ...    ## import particular functions
from myModule import myClass1, myClass2, ...          ## import particular classes
from myModule import myFunction1, myClass1, myVar     ## import particular function, classes, variable

## IMPORTING AND INVOKING FUNCTIONS FROM myModule
## it depends on how the module and the function were imported
## most straightforward way of importing exemplified bellow
import myModule
myModule.myFunction()
```

```python
## Example Importing Module

#--------- test1.py --------- #
# import test2
import datetime
from test2 import *
# from test2 import hello2 as h

def hello1():
    print('Hello from test 1')

hello1()
hello2()

x = datetime.datetime.now()
print(x)

#--------- test2.py --------- #
def hello2():
    print('hello from test 2')

def main():
    hello2()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

#--------- execute test1.py --------- #
❯ python3 test1.py
Hello from test 1
hello from test 2

#--------- execute test2.py --------- #
❯ python3 test2.py
hello from test 2
```

## standard libraries
* python comes with built modules
* modules that come by default with python together make what is called standard libraries
* as with any modules before modules functions and classes can be used they must be imported
* to import modules part of the standard library you do not need to specify their path since python by default knows where they are stored
* standard libraries module examples:
    - random
    - math
    - datetime
    - calendar
    - tikenter

## importing vs executing modules
* the expectation for a module is that is not going to execute code when imported but to make available functionality i.e. variables, functions and classes
* the expectation for an application is that is going to execute when called
* there is a way that you can write a module to be able to be used both:
    - as a module i.e. to be imported in other modules
    - as an application
* this is accomplished by:
    * writing your module: variables, functions and classes
    * writing a function `main()` where you implement everything you want your module to execute
    * adding a conditional statement that only executes the `main()` if the module has been called directly e.g. `python mymodule.py`
* see `80-debugging/debugger.py` as an example
