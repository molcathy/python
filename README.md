## shells - terminals
### shells
* [shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) are programs that allow users to interact with the operating system
* are named shells because they are the outermost layer around the operating system
* shells use either:
    - a command-line interface (CLI)
    - or graphical user interface (GUI)
* for the purpose of this tutorial when we are going to refer to shells we are going to refer to the cli shells
* the shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language
* for now we will focus on the shell as an interactive command language
* there are many flavours of shells
* the most popular shells are:
    - bash: the default Linux shell
    - zsh: the default shell of the latest macOS (Big Sur)
* many aspects of bash and zsh are similar and for the purpose of this tutorial we are going to ignore their differences

### terminals
* [terminal emulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) are computer programs that emulate [video terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal#Dumb_terminals)
* for the purpose of this tutorial when we are going to refer to terminal emulators as terminals
* your terminal lets you interact with your shell which through commands lets you interact with your operating system to perform various tasks e.g.:
    - creating, copying, moving, renaming, removing files and directories
    - download stuff
    - launch programs
* the most popular terminals are:
    - terminal: comes by default with macOS
    - [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/): has more features then the default terminal that comes with interactive command language

### terminal - shell - os
* terminal - shell - os interaction: `user --> terminal --> shell --> commands --> operating system --> apps or hardware`
* to find out your shell you can execute the `echo $SHELL` in your terminal
```sh
## example running the echo command to find your default shell
‚ùØ echo $SHELL
/usr/local/bin/bash
```

### bash commands syntax
* the basic syntax of a bash command is `command [flags] [subcommands] [flags] [argument]` - whatever is brackets enclosed is optional
* in many cases the command, subcommands and flags stand for something making it easier to remember e.g.:
    - `ls`: list
    - `-l`: long
* flags:
    - most of the time are optional
    - both commands and subcommands can have their own flags
    - they modify how a command/subcommand works
    - some flags come in two different forms - when they do they are equivalent:
        + short which must be prepended by `-`: `-v`
        + long: which must be prepended by `--`: `--verbose`
    - multiple short flags can be combined after one `-` e.g. the following are equivalent:
        + `ls -l -a -h`
        + `ls -lah`
* subcommands:
    - sometimes when a command is too complex whoever writes (makes or provides) the command brakes it into 1 command and one ore more subcommands
* arguments:
    - it is whatever the command or subcommand acts upon, e.g. `git clone` command and subcommand act upon an URL downloading it

```sh
# YOU CAN EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS INSIDE A TEST DIRECTORY TO SEE HOW FLAGS MODIFY ITS SUBCOMMAND BEHAVIOR
# command subcommand subcommandFlag  argument
git       clone                      https://github.com/molcathy/python.git
git       clone      -q              https://github.com/molcathy/python.git
git       clone      --quiet         https://github.com/molcathy/python.git
```

## useful bash commands
* there are probably thousands of bash commands, but we are focus on the most basic one of [the most important ones](https://www.google.com/search?q=most+important+bash+commands)
```sh
## print working directory i.e. current directory
pwd

## list files and directories
ls
ls -a    # list hidden files
ls -h    # list in pretty format
ls -a    # list in long format
ls -lah  # list with all 3 flags combined


## make directory
mkdir myDirectory

## change working directory - NOTE: note multiple directory names or files are separated by /
cd myDirectory
cd myDirectory1/myDirectory2
cd /myDirectory1/myDirectory2

## list directories and files recursively as a tree
tree
tree -d     # list directories only
tree -L 3   # limit the number of directories and files you want displayed, here 3
tree -dL 3
tree --help # ! NOTE: often commands come with --help or -h flags that display a help menu

## remove files & directories
rm -vi myFile  # remove file verbosely asking for confirmation
#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
rm -rm myDir   # DANGER THIS COMMAND CAN REMOVE YOUR ENTIRE FILE SYSTEM
               # NEVER run rm -rm ON A ABSOLUTE PATH i.e. starting with /
#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
```

## brew macOS package manager
* only _some_ commands come preinstalled with an OS (**O**perating **S**ystem)  and that is the case for macOS
* on macOS you can install additional bash commands with [brew](https://brew.sh/) e.g. `brew install tree`
* brew itself must be installed first since it does not come by default with macOS
* to install brew follow instructions at https://brew.sh/
* brew is a macOS cli package manger i.e. software that manges other software:
    - lists installed software
    - installs additional software
    - updates installed software
    - remove installed software
* brew let you mange both cli and gui software (with the `--cask` flag)
* you can
```sh
## LISTS INSTALLED PACKAGES
brew list          # cli
brew list --cask   # gui

## INSTALL
brew install git
brew install --cask firefox

## UPDATE & UPGRADE ALL INSTALLED PACKAGES
bre update
brew upgrade

## REMOVE PACKAGES
 # uninstall & remove are equivalent
brew uninstall myPackage
brew remove myPackage
```
